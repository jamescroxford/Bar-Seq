# Bar-Seq
This code is written as part of the project 'Understanding the genome dynamics of Streptomyces clavuligerus during industrial fermentations'. This code was used to analyse fastq files output from Oxford Nanopore Dorado basecalling software. All Python codes were run in Pycharm (community edition 2022.2.1). The code runs on all files within a given folder however can be adjusted to run on a single file if needed.
